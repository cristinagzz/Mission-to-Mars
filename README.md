# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview 
In this module we automated a web browser to enter various websites and gather information on the Mars mission data. This info was store in a NoSQL database, and the data is displayed in a Flask-built web application. 

Web scraping automates laborious operations for smaller-scale, individual initiatives. Web scraping, for instance, make it simple to gather up-to-date news on a particular issue. A web crawler can copy articles from websites without having to visit each one and on this case, we focused on Mars data.

## Results

We include the titles and images of the Mars Hemispheres and the final results are shown as the following image: 
We also changed the backgroud color + include a picture in the Title of the webpage
